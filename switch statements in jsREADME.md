Switch statements in JavaScript are control flow statements used to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. They are particularly useful when you have a single expression that you want to compare to multiple possible values and execute different code based on which value it matches.
Here is a casino counting card project using switch statements;
let count = 0;
function countingCard(card) {
switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }
  if (count > 0) {
    return count + " Bet";
  } else {
    return count + " Hold";
  }
  return "Change Me";
  }
